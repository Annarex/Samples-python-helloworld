This is a simple hello world example to show a Python connection to InterSystems IRIS. It stored data natively into your instance of InterSystems IRIS 

## Run the sample
In the integrated terminal window type: 

* `cd /home/project/Samples-python-helloworld`  
* `npm install wheel/irisnative-1.0.0-cp34-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl`
* `python hello_world.py`

Open the Management Portal and verify that data has been stored in the globals.
